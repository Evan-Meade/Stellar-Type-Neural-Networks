# Stellar-Type-Neural-Networks
Completed as part of a project for the Fall 2019 section of PHYS 3330: Numerical Methods at the University of Texas at Dallas.

Group: Victoria Catlett, Amanda Ehnis, and Evan Meade

This repository serves as an appendix to our report and presentation containing our code for the project, which was completed entirely in MatLab. Different scripts represent different types of neural networks for classifying stars to their stellar types based on their B-V color index and absolute magnitude.
