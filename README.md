# Stellar-Type-Neural-Networks
Completed as part of a project for the Fall 2019 section of PHYS 3330: Numerical Methods at the University of Texas at Dallas.

Group: [Victoria Catlett](https://github.com/vcatlett), [Amanda Ehnis](https://github.com/anehnis), and [Evan Meade](https://github.com/Evan-Meade)

Our project report is included in this repository as ```Report_Catlett_Ehnis_Meade.pdf```, which contains a full description of the projects and our sources. 

This repository serves as an appendix to our report. All of the code in this directory was created in MatLab.

```Classification_Stars``` contains the scripts and data to create a classification neural network which estimates the spectral type of a star from its B-V color index and absolute magnitude.

```Convolutional_Galaxies``` contains the scripts to modify the AlexNet convolutional neural network to classify galaxies as smooth, featured, or artifacts (not actually a galaxy). The data comes from the [2013 Kaggle Galaxy Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge/overview). Per the rules, we cannot post the data (or any modified versions) publicly. Instead, you may download and sort the data yourself, and we have included the necessary folders in the repository. Right now, the folders contain pictures of V. Catlett's cats as placeholders for the galaxy images.
